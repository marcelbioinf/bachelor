This repository contains scripts that I wrote for my bachelor thesis which concerned analysis of promoter sequences and termination signals of transcription in plants' 
tRNA genes and creation of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM). Scripts 1-10 were used for file processing, data extraction and data processing in diferrent kinds of speciffic analysis. 
Last scripts are implementation of PSSM for detecting potential tRNA or tRNA-like genes while scanning genome file.
